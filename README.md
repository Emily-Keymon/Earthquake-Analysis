# Earthquake Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present an interactive map visualization of USGS earthquake data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in GeoJSON format, Leaflet was used to import and process the data, as well as generate the required visualization.

## Tasks

### Level 1: Basic Visualization
Visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get the data set**

 The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.


2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.


### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Pull in a second data set and visualize it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Plot a second data set on the map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to the map.
